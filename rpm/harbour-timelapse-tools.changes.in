* 2022-08-05 Lukáš Karas <lukas.karas@centrum.cz> 0.1-1
- initial release of time-lapse tools for Sailfish OS
- basic features:
 -- capture photos by phone camera (Qt camera api) or external camera (Gphoto2 library)
  --- external camera needs to support PTP over USB and connected via USB OTG adapter
  --- list of supported cameras: http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php
  --- automatic and continuous shutter-speed tuning to avoid under/over exposure
 -- preprocess captured series (with ImageMagick library)
  --- "deflickering" by luminance average of all images or moving average
  --- blend frames (when video frame count is bigger than picture count)
 -- assembly video from captured series (using ffmpeg)
  --- support x264 or x265 video encoders
